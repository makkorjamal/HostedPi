# HsotedPi 
A software to install different hosted services on a raspberrypi
like unbound pihole owncloud etc..

## why?
This is mostly for fun, but many tutorials on installing various self-hosted services are often incomplete and hard to follow. 
Additionally, those interested in self-hosting can find it frustrating to search for different methods to install various packages.

## how does it work?
This software reads different hosted services from a  config file
"config.cfg" and install the them based these requirements
