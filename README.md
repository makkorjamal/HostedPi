# HsotedPi 
A software to install different hosted services on a raspberrypi
like unbound pihole owncloud etc..

## why?
mostly for fun but also most tutorials on how to install different
self hosted services are fragmented and usually not reproducible
Also people who want to self host can find it frustrating to research
for different ways to install different packages.

## how does it work?
This software reads different hosted services from a  config file
"config.cfg" and install the them based these requirements
